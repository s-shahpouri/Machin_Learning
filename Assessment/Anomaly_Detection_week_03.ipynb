    "Anomaly detection techniques are commonly employed in predictive maintenance strategies to identify abnormal patterns or behaviors in machine data that may indicate impending failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "By monitoring various sensor readings, operational parameters, or other relevant data from machines, anomaly detection algorithms can learn the normal behavior or expected patterns of the machines during their normal operation. When a deviation from the normal behavior is detected, it may indicate a potential failure or malfunction. The hypothesis is that the sensor readings of a pump will generate not normal values in case of an (upcoming) failure, and these can be determined with anomaly detection. Several algorithms will be used to evaluate the hypothesis"

    "#### Analyze the end result plot to evaluate the algorithm's performance. Look for anomalies identified by the algorithm and compare them to known anomalies or instances of abnormal behavior in the data. Assess whether the algorithm successfully captures these anomalies and if it shows promising results in detecting abnormal patterns. Based on the plot analysis, provide argumentation for the validity of the anomaly detection algorithm hypothesis (see above). Discuss how the algorithm effectively captures anomalies in the time series data and why it is a suitable approach for the use case. Support your argument with references to relevant literature that discuss the effectiveness of the chosen algorithm or similar algorithms in detecting anomalies in time series data."
