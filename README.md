**Introduction**

This repository contains a series of machine learning assignments carried out as part of the course of Data Science 2.

The tasks are based on clustering, manifold learning, text clustering, anomaly detection, and supervised machine learning techniques such as gradient descent, SVC, decision trees, naive bayes, and bagging vs boosting.

Each of these topics is handled in separate Jupyter notebooks, accompanied by corresponding datasets.

Repository Structure
The repository structure is as follows:

# week01/:
Contains the assignment on clustering methods, focusing on common preprocessing steps, visualization methods, and performance evaluation metrics.
# week02/:
Involves an assignment on manifold learning and text clustering. It entails either improving existing manifold learning code or enhancing the outcome by improving data preprocessing and hyperparameter configurations in text clustering.
# week03/:
Houses the anomaly detection assignment, which requires studying a specific notebook and then choosing from a series of assignment options, such as improving data quality for anomaly detection or testing different algorithms.
# week04/:
The week04 directory includes the task of implementing the gradient descent technique from scratch.
# week05/:
Here, we practice the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and model evaluation using different metrics.
# week06/:
Contains the assignment on decision trees and naive bayes, with different model parameters and varying datasets.
# week07/:
The final week focuses on the comparison between bagging and boosting, where we implement and evaluate a bagging, boosting, and dummy classifier on a breast cancer dataset.

**Installation & Usage**

To install and run these assignments on your local machine, please follow these steps:
